            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Kanye West stands as a quintessential example of how biological, cultural, and psychological factors
                intertwine to mold personal and public identities. Renowned for his groundbreaking contributions to
                music and fashion, and equally known for his controversial public persona, West's candid discussions
                about his bipolar disorder and reflections on his African American identity provide a profound lens to
                examine the impacts of these interwoven elements.</p>

            <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p>Kanye West’s introspective and often controversial lyrics not only shape his artistic identity but also
                challenge societal perceptions of mental health and racial identity, illustrating the significant impact
                of biological and cultural conditions on both personal and public identity.</p>

            <h2>The Interplay of Biology and Identity</h2>
            <p>Bipolar disorder is characterized by significant mood swings which include emotional highs (mania or
                hypomania) and lows (depression). Kanye West addresses this condition openly in his work, particularly
                in his 2018 album "Ye." In the track "Yikes," West boldly declares his bipolar disorder as a
                "superpower," reframing it as a vital, empowering aspect of his identity. This view challenges the
                typical narrative surrounding mental health disorders, presenting them as a source of unique insight
                rather than merely symptomatic of dysfunction.</p>
