            <h2>Question</h2>
            <p>Choose an American and describe how biology has affected the formation of this person’s identity. The
                American you write about could be yourself or a public person, but please do not disclose private
                information about any person other than yourself without permission. If you choose to write about
                yourself, keep in mind that the essay will be read by the instructor and the GSIs, but will not be
                shared with anybody else without your permission. For the purpose of this essay, the definition of an
                American is a person currently residing in the United States regardless of immigration and/or visa
                status.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the realm of celebrity and cultural iconography, few figures provoke as much fascination and debate as
                Kanye West. A polymath whose influence spans across music, fashion, and social commentary, West's
                journey is emblematic of the intricate dance between biology and identity. Central to this narrative is
                his candid dialogue about mental health, which not only shapes his artistry and public interactions but
                also positions him at the heart of a broader societal conversation about wellness and creativity.
                West's exploration of his bipolar disorder offers a window into the complexities of living with a mental
                health condition under the relentless scrutiny of the public eye. His experiences illuminate the
                profound ways in which biological factors can sculpt one's sense of self and outward expression. From
                his provocative statements on historical and social issues to his revolutionary musical and fashion
                projects, West's journey is particularly illuminative of how mental health challenges can sculpt one's
                identity and creative endeavours. Publicly grappling with bipolar disorder, West has navigated the
                tumultuous waters of both acclaim and scrutiny due to escalating opinions and actions. This ongoing
                battle with his mental health not only colours his artistic expression but also informs his public
                persona, making him a compelling figure in discussions on the nexus of biology, identity, and
                creativity.

            <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p>Kanye West’s introspective and often controversial lyrics not only shape his artistic identity but also
                challenge societal perceptions of mental health and racial identity, illustrating the significant impact
                of biological and cultural conditions on both personal and public identity.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Interplay of Biology and Identity</h2>
            <p>Bipolar disorder, characterized by dramatic mood swings that impact behavior and cognitive functions,
                significantly shapes the lives of those it affects. Kanye West addresses this condition openly in his
                work, most notably in his 2018 album "Ye." The track "Yikes" exemplifies this, where West proclaims his
                bipolar disorder as a "superpower," reframing it as an integral part of his identity and creative
                expression. This assertion challenges the traditional narrative surrounding mental health, presenting
                the condition as a source of unique insights rather than a mere disability.
                This perspective is crucial as it transforms public understanding of mental health, suggesting that
                these conditions can coexist with personal success and creativity.
                By claiming his mental health condition as a superpower, West not only alters his own self-perception
                but also offers a new viewpoint for his audience, reshaping how bipolar disorder is viewed in the
                broader cultural context.

            <h2>Public Persona and Artistic Expression</h2>
            <p>West's music deeply reflects his personal struggles, intertwining his mental health with his racial
                identity. In the song "FML" from the album "The Life of Pablo," he discusses the complexities of
                managing mental health in the public eye, especially as a black man in America. He articulates this
                experience with the line, "You ain't never seen nothing crazier than this guy when he's off his
                Lexapro," offering a window into the tumultuous nature of living with a mental health condition under
                relentless public scrutiny.
                Furthermore, his album "Jesus is King" melds his spiritual journey with his personal challenges, using
                his faith as a narrative of redemption and resilience. The track "God Is" encapsulates this blend, with
                West stating, "This ain't 'bout a damn religion / Jesus brought a revolution." Here, West suggests that
                his spiritual rebirth is intertwined with his mental health journey, proposing that his renewed faith
                has been pivotal in managing his bipolar disorder.

            <h2>Cultural Context of Hip Hop and Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Hip hop culture has traditionally prized toughness and resilience, often stigmatizing expressions of
                vulnerability and mental illness as weaknesses. Shannon McInerney's analysis in the Journal of Popular
                Culture underscores how these cultural norms have governed artists' disclosures about their mental
                health (McInerney, 2020). Kanye West, however, breaks these conventions by openly discussing his
                diagnosis of bipolar disorder, thereby challenging the community's longstanding taboos against such
                admissions.
                West’s approach has not only opened new avenues for dialogue within hip hop but also invited a
                revaluation of the expectations placed on artists regarding mental health. By sharing his experiences,
                West encourages a departure from the genre's traditional stoicism, advocating for a more nuanced
                understanding of strength that includes the courage to acknowledge one's vulnerabilities.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Psychological Impact of Public Persona</h2>
            <p>The intersection of West's mental health with his public identity offers a complex scenario for
                psychological analysis. Zoe Jackson in Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies discusses the risks
                associated with conflating racial and biological narratives in public discourse, particularly how they
                might perpetuate stereotypes or influence personal identity (Jackson, 2021). West’s candidness about his
                psychological struggles and the media’s portrayal thereof can both challenge and reinforce existing
                narratives about race and mental health.
                Jackson’s critique highlights the dual potential of such public disclosures: they can demystify and
                destigmatize mental health issues, particularly in the African American community, but also risk
                simplifying the complex interplay of race, biology, and behaviour into easily digestible but potentially
                misleading stereotypes.

        <section>
            <h2>Kanye West and the Alien-Self Disorder</h2>
            <p>Further examining West's psychological landscape, Kevin Cokley's notion of alien-self disorder provides a
                framework for understanding some of West's more controversial behaviors and statements. This concept,
                which describes an alienation from one’s cultural roots accompanied by an overemphasis on materialistic
                achievements, can be seen in West's periodic detachment from traditional African American values and his
                gravitation towards a global, often materialistically driven persona.
                This framework helps explain not only West’s public controversies but also his internal conflicts as he
                navigates his identity within the broader cultural and racial paradigms. His lyrics often reflect a
                struggle between his original cultural identity and the persona shaped by fame and public scrutiny,
                offering a window into his psychological battles and cultural critique.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Kanye West’s lyrics serve as a potent medium for exploring his multifaceted identity, influenced by his
                bipolar disorder and his experiences as an African American. These lyrics do not merely reflect personal
                truths but also respond to and reshape societal dialogues around mental health and racial identity. By
                openly discussing his psychological struggles and cultural heritage, West challenges both stigmas
                against mental illness and simplistic narratives about racial identity in America.</p>
