            <h1>Sonnet 1: The Unfortunate Genes</h1>
            <p>Within the coiled ladders of our cells,<br>
                The scripts are scribed where fate’s harsh truth is spun.<br>
                A misprint in the alleles themselves,<br>
                Can burden hearts before their lives have run.</p>
            <p>Chromosomal maps, inherited with flaws,<br>
                A silent heirloom in the blood's domain.<br>
                These genetic scripts, written without pause,<br>
                Dictate a path marred by hidden pain.</p>
            <p>Yet through the microscope of modern lore,<br>
                We seek to edit what nature misspoke.<br>
                With CRISPR’s shears, we hope to restore,<br>
                The clearest voice from where our genes provoke.</p>
            <p>Though DNA decrees a somber script,<br>
                Our will to rewrite is not eclipsed.</p>

            <h1>Sonnet 2: Ignorance of One's Genes</h1>
            <p>Oblivious he treads through life’s wide gate,<br>
                Unversed in the intricacies of strands,<br>
                Where double helices may seal one's fate,<br>
                Or bless with grace not fathomed by our hands.</p>
            <p>Within each nucleus, our secrets lie,<br>
                Encoded deep in every dividing cell.<br>
                Ignorance may shield us from the sigh,<br>
                Of illnesses that lurk where mutations dwell.</p>
            <p>Yet is bliss truly found in unseen genes,<br>
                Or does truth’s power our destiny recast?<br>
                To arm oneself with what each marker means,<br>
                Can free us from the shadows of the past.</p>
            <p>Though knowledge of our code might fear instill,<br>
                In understanding, lies the power to will.</p>

            <h1>Sonnet 3: Embracing One's Genetic Identity</h1>
            <p>This code of life, my own unique refrain,<br>
                Spelled out in vibrant strands of DNA.<br>
                From forebears' gifts, these genes I ascertain,<br>
                Are maps of old, yet guide me in my way.</p>
            <p>With every allele painting part of me,<br>
                From eye's azure hue to the heart's quiet beat.<br>
                In every chromosome, a sea of possibility,<br>
                Ancestral echoes in retreat.</p>
            <p>Embrace these markers, written by the stars,<br>
                For they are neither fate nor binding chains.<br>
                Instead, they light the skies like cosmic spars,<br>
                Guiding us through life’s vast, uncharted plains.</p>
            <p>Inherit these, your stories, bold and free,<br>
                Your genetic lore, the roots of your own tree.</p>
